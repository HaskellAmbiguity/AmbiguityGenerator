# Ambiguity

This is a Haskell library to expose the "ambiguous random value generator". The mathematical and practical properties of this generator are available in our paper which you can find here: https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307

We would be grateful if you would cite us in work that uses this ambiguity generator. We have provided the BibTeX info here:
